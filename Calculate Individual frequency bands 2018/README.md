## Individual Frequency Bands

proc1 loads eyes-closed and eyes-open EEG resting state data and calculates Power Spectral Density for each of them.

proc2 calculates individual frequency bands using individual alpha frequency (IAF) at Pz. IAF is defined as the bandwidth that desynchronises the most when going from EC to EO (increasing sensory processing). The bandwidth for the theta, alpha, and beta bands were defined using IAF as anchor point and the Golden Mean, g = 1.618 (http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(12)00243-4)
